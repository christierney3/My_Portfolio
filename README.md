** Here is an updated look at my dev portfolio. 

** I chose to add a navbar to make scrolling the page seamless and hassle-free.

**Underneath I included a picture of myself with my dog, Ray and included my name and an about me.

** I then included some of the projects I have recently completed with buttons that will direct the user to their deployed applications.

** My main contact information is then displayed in the footer where the user will be taken to either my LinkedIn, Github, or my Resume.
